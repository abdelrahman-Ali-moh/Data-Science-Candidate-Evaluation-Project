# Data-Science-Candidate-Evaluation-Project
Welcome to the Data Science Candidate Evaluation Project! This project aims to assess candidates with 1 year of experience in data science, focusing on proficiency in Python for data analysis, Flask for deployment and API creation, SQL, Power BI, and data visualization.
# Project Overview
## Objective
Evaluate candidates' skills in data science through a comprehensive assessment of Python, SQL, Power BI, and Flask.

## Dataset
Refer to the attached Dataset Description PDF for a detailed understanding of the provided data.

## Tasks
### 1. Python & SQL for Data Analysis
Implement a Python script to import data into a MySQL database.
Retrieve and analyze data using SQL queries.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.
Clean, preprocess, and perform statistical analysis.
Present key insights in a Jupyter notebook.
### 2. Power BI
Load data from the database using the appropriate connector.
Build a data model for the extracted data.
Design a Power BI dashboard for meaningful insights.
Utilize appropriate visualizations (charts, graphs, etc.).
Submit the Power BI file with an explanation of design choices.
### 3. Flask for Deployment and APIs
Create a Flask web application with two routes: /dashboard and /data.
Use the MySQL database for data visualization in the Flask app.
### 4. Data Visualization
Implement visualizations on the /dashboard page using a library like Plotly or Matplotlib.
Provide insights based on visualizations, leveraging analysis from the Jupyter notebook.
### 5. Documentation
Include clear and concise documentation for the Flask web application.
Describe how to run the Flask application locally.
Ensure well-structured, modular, and best-practice-following code.
### 6. Code Quality
Ensure code readability, structure, and adherence to best practices.
Implement error handling for a graceful user experience.
### 7. Bonus (Optional)
Implement user authentication for accessing the /dashboard route.
Dockerize the Flask application.
Submission Guidelines
Submit all code and files in a compressed folder or via a version control system (GitHub).
Include a README file or PDF with instructions on running, testing, and additional notes.
Evaluation Criteria
Candidates will be evaluated based on:

Accuracy and clarity of Python data analysis code and Flask web application.
Code structure, readability, and adherence to best practices.
Successful deployment of Flask app and functionality of the API.
Correct and efficient use of SQL queries.
Effectiveness and creativity in Power BI dashboard design.
Clear and insightful data visualizations.
Bonus points for implementing optional features.
We look forward to reviewing your submission and assessing your skills in this comprehensive data science evaluation project!
